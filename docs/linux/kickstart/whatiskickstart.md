# What is Kickstart

Kickstart is the scripted autoinstaller system in RHEL based systems. 

As with most RHEL based systems, even if you are using CentOS, You can use the [RHEL Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/chap-kickstart-installations) as a refrence to your kickstart profile.

The quicket way to get started with kickstart is to utalize the kickstart that anaconda has created when it installed your system. This is included in the ````/root```` dir.

You can also see additional tools at [Redhats Docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/installation_guide/sect-kickstart-howto#sect-kickstart-maintain)
